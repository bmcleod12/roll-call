# Team Profile Generator

## Description
This command line application creates a website with information about members of your team.

##  Installation

As this is just a class project, it has not been added for public use in the npm registry, so we will install it the long way - downloading the code via zip file.

A walkthrough video for these installation and usage instructions can be found here: 

Please note these installation instructions assume you already have Visual Studio Code installed, as well as Node.js.

Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/ 

Node.js: https://nodejs.org/en/


1. Click the Code button at the top right of this repository, then click Download ZIP.

2. Open the zip folder location once it completes downloading.



3. Right click on the zip file and select "Extract All..."



4. Browse for the location where you would like to extract the files.




5. After the zip is extracted, right click on the folder and select "Open with Code"



6. In Visual Studio, right click in the parent folder and select "Open in Integrated Terminal."




7. In the Integrated Terminal, enter "npm i" and hit Enter. This will install both fs and inquirer from the npm registry.




8. Upon completion, thre will be a new node_modules folder in your Visual Studio, giving you what you need to run the program.


## Usage

To use the application, with Integrated Terminal still open in your VS Code:

1. Enter "node index.js"



2. A series of questions will be asked, prompting you to provide information for each member of your team. After answering each question and assuming nothing goes wrong, you will be presented with a message reading, "Successfully created index.html!"



3. The html file will be created...
